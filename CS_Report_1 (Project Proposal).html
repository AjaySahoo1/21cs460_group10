        <h1> <u>Stock Prediction using SVR</u></h1>
        <br>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>We all know the value of money. Everyone wants to earn to live a stable life. But we also want to become rich with low efforts and great advantages. We all have some kind of wish list in our mind and we need a lot of money to fulfill
those desires. Stock market is one of the best platform for this. But again there are risks which we don't want. Or do you want to take risk and lose your money? No, right? Even though there are risks one can forecast the stocks 
by visualising the past stock values and some statistical factors.</p>

<p>In this project we are trying to plots of financial data of a specific company by using tabular data provided by "yfinance" python library. Again we will create a Support Vector Regression(SVR) model to predict upcoming stock 
prices. This will reduce the risk factor for the investors.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Datasets and Idea</h2>
<p>We are going to use Yahoo Finanace, Quandle and if possible some other platform from which we can get sufficient dataset for stock prediction. We will create a SVR model. We will split the data set into training and testing data.
After training the model we will check the performance of the model by using different metrics(e.g mean square error, mean absolute error). We have already studied about the Support Vector Machine for Linear Regression and SVR uses same 
principle as SVM.

<hr/>

<h2>Work Division</h2>
<p>No team is a perfect team without teamwork and coordination. We will discuss everything about our work. But roughly saying, Ajaya is going to give the 1st and 2nd Presentation, create slides and Prateek is going to
present the last presentation, provide the summary of all theories for the report. Creating ML model using python and handling website for reports will come under joint task. </p>

<hr/>

<h2> Mid-way work and Expecting results</h2>
<p>Since we are taking support vector machine as our baseline, our main focus is to understand how the SVR algorithm works theoratically. After that we will try to build the model for it, test the performance of trained model, forecast 
the stock for a certain date by plotting a graph between "exponential moving average vs date". At the latter stage we are planning to compare the result with the result obtained by other algorithm for example Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) model.</p>
<p> There are some difficulties we might face such as SVR model may not work for large data sets, choosing a good kernel and fine-tuning the hyperparameters are not easy task. So the final goal of the project to bulld a model that might
overcome some of these obstacles.</p>
